    Update to InventoryRenderHelperV2? https://github.com/WayofTime/BloodMagic/blob/1.9/src/main/java/WayofTime/bloodmagic/util/helper/InventoryRenderHelperV2.java

    Bugs found in 1.10
        JEI integration wacko
            no custom categories
            wait for mezz on IRC
    Add from 1.10 found stuff
        translation files, make their character escapes equal to en_us
        Fix player capabilities (WIP)
        Update changelog

    
    Notes from 1.7 playthrough:

        add as tooltip that extended inventory/increased upgrade points type
            change tooltip so that it says Alternate Upgrades, not alt gui, too confusing
            or 'Configurable Upgrades'

        Move a lot of info from the tooltip to the info jei tab
        shorten upgrade necessary backpack tier tooltip? -yes, with help of jei info tab it will be fine
        mek style tooltips with alt tooltip as well as shift?

        allow enter to be hit to act as hitting renaming button


    1.8 Stuff:

        Features:

            Backpacks:
                Make them dyeable (I don't use damage values, I might as well)

                eventual integration with travelers gear, tiCon (backpack slot), baubles, etc.

                add to info JEI description explanation of values in shift pressing

            API:
                Add backpack tab (like TiCon)
                    Add in clickable tab with icon and tooltip (in the correct location even if TiCon, etc, is installed)
                    Render steve backwards so you can see the backpack
                    Add in slot for the backpack to go on
                    Optional
                        Add in upgrade removal stuff
                            Slot to put pack in
                            Slot to take pack out of
                            Upgrade to remove slot
                            Button to iterate through upgrade to remove

                add IFilterUpgrade?

            Upgrades:
                cleanup event restocking
                make event upgrades not sort the backpack before doing their things.
                    tick handler too

                make the upgrades cheaper overall, introduce t1 and t2 crafting bases

                make crafting advanced filter

                some upgrade to increase storage slots?
                    rows and columns?
                    probably not

                add a way to remove additional upgrade points upgrades?

                add informational jei tabs (remove tooltips?)

                advanced info tooltips that show the category (configurable/conflicting/etc.) and extra info

            JEI:
                 add tooltip over all the output and input items b/c nbt independent (i.e. has upgrade, upgrade removed)

                 minor: tooltips have slightly lager space between first line and second, remove that


            Investigate:
                add crafttweaker support
                Send packet to client when join server to sync metas up

            Crafting:

                Remove treated leather and nest

                Remove adding crafting item to API?
                    https://github.com/WayofTime/BloodMagic/blob/1.8-Rewrite/src/main/java/WayofTime/bloodmagic/item/ItemSlate.java

                Make basic recipe use less leather and rebalance a lot of them
                    Make lib folder to store all that stuff

            Other:

                cleanup lang file

                add commands to remove stored packs' IEEP data
                Make more null checks for backpack entity killing/spawning

                add all static methods to helpers in API
                go through TODOs in code
                Check all comments/javadocs

                texture update (message CyanideX/interview person) - message BBoldt again
                    Make textures of upgrades more 3D looking

                Add achievements

                Check that it works with new forge and IItemHandler

                    <pauljoda> https://github.com/TeamBR-Modding/Bookshelf/blob/1.8/src/main/scala/com/teambr/bookshelf/util/InventoryUtils.scala
                    <pauljoda> That code will allow you to move items between inventories, supports old inventories and the new ones by wrapping old objects to the new system
                    <pauljoda> https://github.com/TeamBR-Modding/Bookshelf/blob/1.8/src/main/scala/com/teambr/bookshelf/common/tiles/traits/Inventory.scala
                    <pauljoda> This holds our inventory code on the new system, we kept the old methods for internal use as they work well. But others can't access them unless they are using Bookshelf
                    <pauljoda> https://github.com/TeamBR-Modding/Bookshelf/blob/1.8/src/main/scala/com/teambr/bookshelf/common/tiles/traits/InventorySided.scala
                    <pauljoda> That wraps the sidedness
                    <pauljoda> For the sided, you must override hasCapability in the tile entity. Otherwise it won't work
                    <gr8pefish> thanks, I'll look through that
                    <pauljoda> No problem, feel free to ask me if you have any questions. If I'm not here, try #neotech

                tehnut's advanced tooltips?

            Gradle:
                gradle auto-increment version broken
                Add sources/api/javadoc/etc. jars to curseforge upload, make sure they work too

            Config:

                finish redoing it

                bm blacklist for config to disable items (requested config option)

                add blacklist for items the backpack can't be equipped with in armor slot (i.e jetpacks)

            CurseForge/MCF:
                Add that you need java 8 for 2.x.x and up
                Make curseforge page look more like PortableCrafting's
                Make wiki (either github or curseforge) link for 1.8 documentation
                    Fill in wiki with pictures and info about the mod
                Add more pictures to curseforge page

        Bugs:
            Testing:
                Run benchmarks/performance tests with iron backpacks installed

                Check working with inventory tweaks
                Check working with Botania

                Test ondeath save to title
                probably breaks when you go through the end portal too

                test everything post-API refactor

            Minor:

            Major:

            Forge:
                ShapedOreRecipes not working with getRemainingItems, report bug.
                    I just overrode it [matches], copying the matches code directly from ShapelessOreRecipe, and it works. So I think it actually might be some sort of forge bug where those recipes aren't registered properly, or it doesn't call the OreRecipes correctly or something else, I'm not sure.



    NOW:

		
    SOON:

        GIT STUFF:

        REFACTOR:

            Data storage in player pack?
                check register packets also had to server side - ex: error on server startup if no getClientPlayer() - that's a bug
                Make it all server - try again, since I fixed the getParentStack bug

        TESTING:


        BUGS:


        ADDITIONS/TWEAKS:
            Tick Handler
                Restocking upgrade onItemPlaced - ask in IRC if the onBlockPlacedEvent exists
                Crafting upgrade onItemPutInBackpack (so for manually putting items in)

            Open right click direct from 'e' inventory?

            Have quick deposit upgrade work with equipped backpack
                use a keybinding?

            Have depth upgrade apply to the IBlockProvider --> wait for Vazkii API update

            Add ender upgrade(s)?
                depthEnder - allows you to use the filter/restocking to go into an ender pouch in the inventory
                vanillaEnder - vanilla ender chest linked backpack (with backpack able to take upgrades)
                remoteEnder - or specified filter linking to a specific chest

            Add in more inter-mod compatibility
                right click in my backpack to open TE satchels, golden bag of holding, etc.
                    look into if this is possible
                    test this

            Make it so you can't move the opened backpack with number key presses, as there might be some dupe bug using that that I missed

            Add Baubles integration as belt slot to equip
                config option to toggle between?
                Traveler's gear compat too

            crafting upgrade check if backpack is full (#31)
                should do a different long-term solution because you can maybe make less slots even if the backpack is full with crafting
                so a simple check for 'do all the slots have items' isn't sufficient. I should check if it has anything but a tiny crafting
                upgrade since the other two can condense item slots (assuming there is space for them to put the new items).

        EXTRA:
            add -b to beta versions in build.gradle

            Fancier config updating/replacing values
                See botania, vazkii is going to implement something similar
                    check current version somehow and compare to origin/versions.txt, if less then do something

            fancy crafting upgrade - choose 1 or 2 or 3 diameter w/ button underneath (like adv. filter)

            mining filter - change so it picks up cobble and smooth stone too and remove from alt gui?

            change it so an entityItem looks to fill a stack in the player's inv before going in filter?

            quick deposit into AE terminals - have to check efficient of deposit code for that to work probably

            Change sorting to a configurable style (i.e. id, name, etc.) w/ right click sort button to change style in game

            add in config option (and subsequent functionality) where the itemBackpack can't be opened directly, it has to be equipped to be open (i.e. only one open at a time)
                hard mode: weight is a factor? Harder nesting recipe for limited space? Some other way to increase space/nesting via gameplay/in-game research/other?
                no shapeless crafting for removal of upgrades, have to use the crafted one specifically

            Recipes via config - support meta/damage values


    LATER:

        //Craft any backpack surrounded by planks to turn it into a placeable custom chest/tileEntity and then shapeless craft the chest to get the backpack back (IChestable)
        Place down TileEntityBackpack directly - if the controls can work that way, if not do the chest method
            (IChestable)

        Power/Fluid/Gas Upgrades (dynamic sizing on left side)


    EVENTUAL FEATURES:
        Gui Config

        custom handling with other mods armors special rendering to render my pack in special spots?

        Barrel Backpacks (implement IChestable)
            4 tiers (or upgrade and drops excess items onto ground), or adds barrel slot like a DSU?

        Craft a diamond/barrel/ender (IDyeable) backpack with dyes to color it
