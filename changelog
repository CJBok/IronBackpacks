Version 1.7.10 - 1.2.11
------------------------------------------------------
Additions
- The ability to remove an upgrade by shapelessly crafting the backpack in a crafting grid
    - The upgrade removed is dependent on the slot it is placed into
    - So to remove the 2nd upgrade on the backpack, put it in the second slot in the crafting grid etc.
    - Note that this doesn't remove the old system, you can still craft an upgrade with a backpack that already has it to specifically remove said upgrade

Version 1.7.10 - 1.2.8
------------------------------------------------------
Additions
- The backpack is now an IBlockProvider (from Botania's API) meaning it can supply items to The Rod of the Shifting Mantle
    Note that this only works if the backpack is in the inventory, it doesn't work if it is equipped.
    This is not on my end, but I have contacted Vazkii and a fix should hopefully occur though.

Changes
- Localized a lot more of the code.
- The backpacks only save their inventory when the inventory actually updates.
- Reverted back to the old versioning system of Major-Minor-BuildNumber

Bug Fixes
- Closes #30 (Equipped backpack works correctly with dimension changes)
- Closes #31 (Crafting upgrade shouldn't cause as much lag)
- Closes #34 (Sneak right clicking with a certain set of upgrades doesn't crash it)
------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------
Additions
- Small Crafting Upgrade: Crafts in a 2x2 grid (ex: sand -> sandstone)
- Small Crafting Upgrade: Crafts in a 1x1 grid (so a single item, ex: wood -> planks)

Changes
- Description of of mining filter to show that it picks up gems and dusts as well.
- Changed versioning to r(MC_Version)-(Mod_Version) (ex: r1.7.10-26) because I am doing a lot of builds
- gradle.build is fancier now (by default it will clean, update version number, build, upload to curse, and make a new changelog segment for the next version)

Bug Fixes
- Precautionary fix for sided inventories and inserting items via the quick deposit upgrade (may fix the unduplicated StorageDrawers bug)
