Hey there. Looks like you want to contribute with an issue. **Great!** Here's what you should do:

* If you haven't reported issues before, please skim through the steps on (Vazkii's) [Bug Reporting 101](http://vazkii.us/br101/).

* As a general overview:
  * Before posting anything, please check if the issue has already been posted/resolved.
  * If it has not, please follow the template provided.

---

Please start your title with one of the following 3 words:

* __Fix__ - for a bug
* __Add__ - for a new feature
* __Improve__ - for an enhancement

Try to be descriptive yet brief. Ideally an issue would then look like one of the following:

* `Fix Dupe On Opening Backpacks`
* `Add Ultimate Restocking Upgrade`
* `Improve UI Buttons`

* Note the following points:
  * Issues regarding outdated versions of the mod are **not accepted**. Try updating, and if the error persists then please post it!
  * If you have an issue with a modpack, make sure it is this mod that is causing the error before posting it, and that you have the updated versions of all the relevant mods.
  * Duplicate issues or issues that have been solved already (use the search feature please) will be closed without asking.

Thanks for reading! You can actually report the issue [here](https://github.com/gr8pefish/IronBackpacks/issues).
