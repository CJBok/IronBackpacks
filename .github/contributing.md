Hey there. Looks like you want to contribute with an issue. **Great!** Here's what you have to do:

* Read through the steps on (Vazkii's) [Bug Reporting 101](http://vazkii.us/br101/) (You may skip this if you're already familiar with reporting issues, but it's good for newcomers);

* As a general overview:
 * Before posting anything, please check if the issue has already been posted/resolved.
 * If it has not, please include the following:
  * Minecraft and Iron Backpacks versions
  * Steps to reproduce. _Be as detailed as possible_.
  * Versions of any mods potentially related to the issue.
  * Any relevant screenshots/videos are greatly appreciated.
  * For crashes the crash report (please put it in a link to pastebin/puu.sh/etc. so it doesn't clog up the bug report).

* Note the following points:
  * Issues regarding outdated versions of the mod are **not accepted**;
  * If you have an issue with a modpack, make sure it is this mod that is causing the error before posting it, and that you have the updated versions of all the relevant mods.;
  * Duplicate issues or issues that have been solved already (use the search feature!) will be closed without asking.
  * Do not tag your issues' names. "Something Broke" is preferred to "[Bug] Something Broke"  because there's a proper label system in place.

* These are the known bugs and they will be ignored:
 * Scrolling too fast in the advanced filter dupes items (but they are ghost items so it is no big deal).
 * Mod armors that have larger custom models might overlap with my backpack model, but it is just visually annoying.

* The more you follow these rules the easier it is for me to actually help you and fix these bugs. Thank you!

If you want to make a Pull Request keep these points in mind:
* Do NOT use the github editor. Test your PRs before you submit them.
* Make sure your PR's syntax matches the syntax of the rest of the code.
* If your pull request edits very small chunks of code and isn't flawless I'll close it as it'll probably take less time to fix it myself rather than pull yours and change the code.
* Unless you have a very good reason for it, keep your PRs all in one commit. You can do it with [rebase](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase).
* If you want to add a feature I recommend discussing it with me beforehand so that all your work isn't for naught if I have to deny it.
