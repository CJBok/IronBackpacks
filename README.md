Iron Backpacks deals with portable storage and item manipulation through tiered backpacks and a system of modular upgrades.

## Rewrite status

Iron Backpacks is currently undergoing a full rewrite. gr8pefish is currently traveling the world, so the majority of the work is being done by TehNut.

Currently the backpacks themselves have basic functionality and upgrades are being slowly added back.
